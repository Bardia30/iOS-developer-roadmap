iOS Developer Roadmap 2022 is a learning path to understand iOS development.

## What is iOS App Development?
iOS is Appleâ€™s mobile operating system (OS) that runs on hardware including iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. An iOS application is programmed in languages such as [Swift](https://gavinw.me/swift-macos/) and [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) and then deployed to the App Store for users to download.

* Check for authentication of user from: https://api.github.com/users
* Use gitHub doc : https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user
* Display data in table view from below API. - on All Users screen
    - https://api.github.com/users
* Display user avatar(image), name into TableViewCell. 
* On Cell click user information should be displayed with Name, avatar , followers, following  on another screen.

- First cell should have + sign to load more Images in particular section and it should be the last cell after adding images.
- Store images into database, & it should be accessible offline.
- Also provide Delete[multiple selection] & move facility in gallery & it should also delete & move in database. 

## Sprint 5
* [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and RxCocoa
    - Rx-Swift is a reactive programming library in iOS app development. It is a multi-platform standard, its difficult-to-handle asynchronous code in Swift, that becomes much easier in Rx-Swift. RxSwift makes it easy to develop dynamic applications that respond to changes in data and respond to user events. Ultimately, it solves the issues related to asynchronous development.

* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/SwiftUI)
    - [Introducing SwiftUI](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/16254084#overview)

#### Practical 5.1
* Design [this screen](https://github.com/canopas/iOS-developer-roadmap/blob/main/assets/Practical-5.1.gif) using SwiftUI. It should be responsive and should support all iOS and iPad devices.

* [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)
    - [Intro to SwiftUI Combine and Data](https://designcode.io/swiftui-combine-intro)

#### Practical 5.2
* Create simple TODO app with CRUD operation with SQLite using SwiftUI and Combine.
    - Home screen should have list of task with add new task fab button.
    - On the click of task it should be redirect to task status screen where it can be edit.
    - On the cell swipe it shows delete option and on it's click that particular task should delete.
    - Add option to active and inactive task.

## Sprint 6

* [Combine Asynchronous Code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/using-combine-for-your-app-s-asynchronous-code)
* [async/await in SwiftUI](https://peterfriese.dev/posts/swiftui-concurrency-essentials-part1)
* [Networking with Combine and SwiftUI](https://peterfriese.dev/posts/swiftui-combine-networking-gettingstarted)

#### Practical 6.0
* Retrieve and display simple users list from web API to iOS List(SwiftUI). Display name, email and city in list.

* API Info:
    - Type: GET
    - Path: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. 

* Notes:
    - App should support all iPhone and iPad
    - Project should be under version control system(use git)
    - Use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for API call
    - Cell first show name only and it expand on tap or button like down arrow and show email and city

* Features:	
     - Delete user on long press.
     - Add SwipeToRefresh functionality 
     - Store users in the database using CoreData. Refresh them in the database when SwipeToRefresh is triggered.
     - Implement Add user functionality with three text box of name, email and city
     - On the user item select event show itâ€™s details in the new screen (Controller).
     - Implement swiping functionality using UICollectionView. On the user detail screen we should be able to move the next/previous user with a horizontal swipe.
